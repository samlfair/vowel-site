This project is still very young, and could use lots of help. Here are a few ways you could support Vowel.

## Feedback

Vowel aspires to serve as an excellent generator for all sorts of websites. To accomplish that, we need great semantic HTML markup and good CSS boilerplates. (That's the bread and butter of the web.) Take a look at the generated HTML and offer thoughts on how to improve it. Look through the CSS themes and give a review.

## Themes

As a semantic HTML generator, one of Vowel's superpowers is that it can be themed infinitely. I'm hoping to publish a library of themes for Vowel. Want to create a theme? That would be awesome!

:::warning

Please know that the Vowel API is still changing, so any CSS you write might need to be updated in the near future.
