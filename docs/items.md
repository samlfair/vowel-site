# Items

With Vowel, you can create reusable pieces of content and embed them throughout your website.

To create one, prefix a file or folder with a `$`, such as `$faqs`. The file or folder will not produce a page, but the content can be displayed on other pages, like so:

```md
Here are answers to common questions:

/$faqs?count=10
```

This also allows richer content, as the item will be displayed with frontmatter.
