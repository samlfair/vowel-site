Vowel include some default styles. You can disable them by settings `theme` to `none` in your root `settings.md`.

Create an `assets/styles.css` file for your styling. We recommend using a style framework like Pico or Open Props. You can simply download their stylesheet and either copy-paste it into your own or include it in `assets/` and `import` it into `assets/styles.css`.

Beware: This project is still in development, so the generated markup is likely to change quickly and without warning, which will break your CSS. You might want to pin your version.
