Vowel include some default styles.

Create an `assets/styles.css` file for your styling. We recommend using a style framework like Pico or Open Props. You can simply download their stylesheet and either copy-paste it into your own or include it in `assets/` and `import` it into `assets/styles.css`.

Beware: This project is still in development, so the generated markup is likely to change quickly and without warning, which will break your CSS. You might want to pin your version.
