Vowel is a very simple Markdown- and CSS-based website generator.

[Edit this page on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/samlfair/vowel-site?file=.stackblitzrc).

To try it out, `cd` into a directory of markdown files and run:

```
npx -p svelte@next -p vowel@latest npx vowel
```

(This `npx` command forces the Svelte 5 peer depedency, without which the app will throw an error.)

Vowel is a minimal website framework for developers who love to write CSS and read RSS.

> Here's a lovely block quote.

Vowel will generate a feature-rich HTML website from a directory of markdown files. The output is plain HTML. You can style it however you want with your own CSS.

Vowel is created by Sam Littlefair. If you have questions or comments, [reach out to me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/samlfair).

**Warning!** This project is still in early development. There are many bugs and the API is changing quickly.
