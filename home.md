Start editing this page with one click by [opening it on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/samlfair/vowel-site?file=home.md).

:::

To try Vowel out on your own computer, `cd` into a directory of markdown files and run:

```
npx -y -p svelte@next -p vowel@latest npx vowel
```

(This `npx` command forces the Svelte 5 peer depedency, without which the app will throw an error.)

Vowel is a minimal website framework for developers who love to write CSS and read RSS.

> Here's a lovely block quote.

Vowel will generate a feature-rich HTML website from a directory of markdown files. The output is plain HTML. You can style it however you want with your own CSS.

:::warning

This project is still in early development. There are many bugs and the API is changing quickly.
