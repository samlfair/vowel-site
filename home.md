Vowel is a very simple Markdown- and CSS-based website generator.

To try it out, `cd` into a directory of markdown files and run:

```
npx -p svelte@next -p vowel@latest npx vowel
```

(This `npx` command forces the Svelte 5 peer depedency, without which the app will throw an error.)

Vowel is a minimal website framework for developers who love to write CSS and read RSS.

> Here's a lovely block quote.

Vowel will generate a feature-rich HTML website from a directory of markdown files. The output is plain HTML. You can style it however you want with your own CSS.

See a [demo on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-nh7m7v?file=home.md). (**Error:** This demo might not work due conflicts in Svelte 5's peer dependencies.)

Vowel is created by Sam Littlefair. If you have questions or comments, [reach out to me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/samlfair).

**Warning!** This project is still in early development. There are many bugs and the API is changing quickly.
